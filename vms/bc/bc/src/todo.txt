Notes:
------
Will need to apply tidal stream by modifying drag in ahead/lateral directions, instead of as a simple offset when the own ship is moved!

Terrain related:
----------------
When terrain is stable, move back into CTerrainSceneNode (in Irrlicht) for speed boost (Probably not needed with better build options)

Radar:
------
Off centre
MARPA
Add joystick button mapping for radar cursor setting, and display cursor range and bearing

Ship response:
--------------
Review mass, thrust, radius of gyration and turn parameters for sanity
Extend calculator for turn dynamics
'Bounce' response to land

Sea:
----
Investigate alternative approaches to sea render:
    Geometry shader
    Sun reflections
    White tips
